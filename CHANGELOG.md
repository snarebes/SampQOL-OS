SampQOL OS Release Notes
========================

SampQOL OS is a mod for the MPC Sample firmware 1.3.0. It starts from the
SD card and does not flash the device. Without the SD card, the MPC starts
as stock 1.3.0.

These notes show all that SampQOL OS does differently from stock 1.3.0.
See the MANUAL for how to use each function.

A SampQOL project opens on a stock MPC Sample, but the mod functions (more
tracks, submixes, inserts, EQ, mutes) do not work there.
Tested only with MPC Sample 1.3.0. MPC One, Live and X are not tested yet.

Version 0.1.4.9 (31 October 2026)
---------------------------------

START-UP AND SAFETY

- With the SD card in, SampQOL OS starts by itself at start-up, without a
  question. Without the SD card, the MPC starts as stock 1.3.0.
- Stock with the SD card in: rename the folder "autorun" (for example to
  "autorun-off"), or move it off the top level of the card. See the MANUAL,
  Troubleshooting.

FIXED

- FULL LEVEL (SHIFT + PAD 1) works in the Pad View and the Track View: each
  new note from a pad has full velocity.


Version 0.1.4.8 (31 October 2026)
---------------------------------

SEQUENCES AND TRACKS

- Explode: a pad with Out Master goes to Out Track on its new track, so
  the track strip meters, mutes and sets its volume.

MIXER AND EFFECTS

- Mixer: B1 shows the submix that the current pad (or its track) goes to.

FIXED

- The SD card works with each card name. In 0.1.4.7 a card with a name
  other than "MPC" (for example "MPC SAMPLE", the name the MPC gives when it
  formats a card) showed "No SD card" on the folder pages, saved projects
  and exports on Internal, and did not keep the Settings.
- Mixer: the Ch. Mixer and Pad Mixer screens do not flicker during
  playback.


Version 0.1.4.7 (30 October 2026)
---------------------------------

HIGHLIGHTS

- Up to 16 drum tracks in a project.
- Step Edit: a Pad View with a step sequencer, and a Track View with one
  row for each track.
- Mixer: inserts on pads, tracks, 8 submixes and the master.
- Pad EQ: a 3-band kill EQ for each pad, with a live spectrum.
- Chop Mode: up to 128 slices, and Extract to pads without a new WAV.
- Record pad mutes and track mutes.
- A MIDI keyboard plays the selected pad chromatically.
- Sample Select: make a new folder on the SD card.
- An Undo counter, and Undo on SAMPLE RECORD.
- Sample Record: To Seq puts the take in the sequence, and a Looper records
  more passes.
- Export: a mixdown and stems of a sequence as WAV.

BUTTONS THAT WORK DIFFERENTLY

- SHIFT + SAMPLE opens the Pad View (Step Edit). Stock: Input Config.
- PAD FX opens the Mixer. Stock: Pad FX.
- Settings > Shortcuts gives back the stock screens.
- Select the track: hold PAD BANK and turn the encoder, or push
  SHIFT + PAD BANK + a pad (1-16).
- Chop Mode: Extract makes no new WAV. Stock: a new WAV for each chop.

START-UP AND SAFETY

- At start-up, the MPC asks "Start SampQOL OS?". B1 = Start.
  B3 = Cancel = stock 1.3.0.
- A start-up screen shows the logo and the version. Ready in about 17 s.
- A watchdog starts the mod again after a crash. Two crashes = stock.
- On a firmware other than 1.3.0, the MPC starts as stock.
- Crash logs go to the SD card.
- A safety net keeps the samples that stock deletes at load. If stock
  changed the project, the MPC asks to load or delete the recovery copy.
- The browsers do not show the "autorun" folder of the mod.
- SD Card Access works with the mod.

SETTINGS

- A new Settings screen, next to MIDI Config, with all mod options.
- Start drive for samples and for projects, CPU/RAM monitor and battery
  monitor.

- Show Knob Values, screen brightness and pad brightness.
- Shortcuts: pick the screen of SHIFT + pad, SHIFT + SAMPLE and PAD FX.
- Hide the triplet grids.

- All knobs on the mod screens follow Parameter Takeover, as stock knobs.

SAMPLE MODE

- Pad EQ: a 3-band kill EQ for each pad, with a live spectrum.

  abruptly.
- 16 Levels Scale: the pads play a scale, a chord or an arpeggio.

  Manual. The slices stay, also on an MPC without the mod.

FIXED (STOCK PROBLEMS)

- 16 Levels: hold pad 1, push pad 2, release pad 1: pad 2 stopped too.

KNOWN ISSUES

- A stock MPC Sample loads only the first drum track of a SampQOL project.
  Recorded pad mutes and the Track Volume do not play there.
- Without SampQOL OS, the Pad EQ and a Hidden master effect do not play, and
  the Kill EQ insert plays as a PEQ 2-Band, 2-Shelf (no kill).
- Without SampQOL OS, a chord on one pad in Note On mode stops at the
  shortest note.
